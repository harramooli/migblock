implement failsafe thing for when the minecrtaft layer crashes or is disconnected
    see mineflayer.events.kicked and error and stuff


add all events to the jslayer, maybe create another file for it, see manilla for how
to implement this, and yea use another file for events, events.js or something

create loglayer for minecraft interface, log all recv from mcil.stdout
use this for logging to test if any async issues accur:
    spawn\n-21chunkLo2ad3\nas\n
probably wont happen like that, but a log should be created to test/debug/see anyway











way in teh future:
prismarineJS/chunk contains light data...
    maybe this can be used to render lighting?
        without even having to calc it ourselves?
            wow...
                starts in 1.14, so we can use it from there
                    finish all versions completely first tho
                    then update, i think thats a good way to go
